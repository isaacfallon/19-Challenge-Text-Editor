## Description

This project is a text editor Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using the Indexed Database API Javascript interface and deployed at a live website via Render.

I built this application as a way to create notes that can be viewed either online or offline if the application is downloaded as a PWA. 

By completing this project, I have a better understanding of how PWA's are utilised to provide functionality either with or without an internet connection.
